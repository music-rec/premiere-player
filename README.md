![Premiere Player. A music player for modern browsers](public/preview.jpg)

Premiere Player is a music player built with [Premiere](https://github.com/pedsmoreira/premiere), [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [MobX](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/).

This is an experimental project. The music comes from Youtube iframes.
